These principles have guided this learning repo:

- **Programming is best learnt by doing.**
A high proportion of the material consists of exercises, and struggling with
them should occupy most of your time. 

- **Exericse should be realistic and substantial**
> "You never let [the learner] do something that isn't the real thing -- but you
> have to work your ass off to figure out what the real thing is in the context
> of the way their minds are working at that developmental level." - Alan Kay

- **Learning to program is learning a mental model**
