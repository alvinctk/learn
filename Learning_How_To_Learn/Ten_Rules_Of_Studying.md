## 10 Rules of Good Studying 

### Use recall
After reading a page, look away and recall the main ideas.

Highlight very little, and never highlight anyhting you haven't put your mind
first by recalling. 

Try recall main ideas when you are working on other tasks.

An ability to recall -- to generate the ideas from inside yourself -- is one of
the key indicators of good learning. 

### Test yourself

Test yourself on everything. All the time. Flash cards are your friend.


### Space your repetition

Spread out your learning in any subject a little every day, just like an
athelete. 

Your brain is like a muscle -- it can handle only a limited amount of exercise
on one subject at a time. 

### Alternate different problem solving techniques during your practice

Never practice too long at any one session using only one problem-solving technique.

Mix it up and work on different types of problems. This teaches you how and when to
use a technique. (Books generally are not set up this way, so you will need to
do this on your own). 

After every assignment and test, go over your errors, make sure you understand
why you made those errors, and then rework your solutions. 

Handwriting builds stronger neural structures in memory than typing.

Quiz yourself randomly on different types of problems.

### Take breaks

Take a break allows your mind to relax. 


### Use explanatory questioning and simple analogies

Whenever you are struggling with a concept, think to yourself, How can I
explain this so that a ten-year old can understand it? 

Using an analogy helps. 

Don't think your explanation -- say it out loud or put it in writing. 

The additional effort of speaking and writing allows you to deeply encode (that
is, convert into neural memory structures) what you are learning. 

### Focus 

Power down all disrupting devices. 

Turn on a timer for twenty five minutes.

Focus intently for those twenty five minutes. And, try to work as digiliently
as you can. 

After timer goes off, give yourself a small fun reward. 

Positive reinforcement - small fun rewards - helps to move your study session
forward. 

### Eat your frogs first

Do the hardest task earliest in the day when you are fresh. 

### Make a mental contrast

Imagine when you have come from and contrast that with the dream of where your
studies will take you. 

Post a picture or words in your workspace to remind you of your dreams. 

Look at that when you find your motivation lagging. This work will pay off both
for you and those who love you!

## 10 Rules of Bad Studying

> Avoid these techniques -- they can waste your time even while they fool you
> into thinking you're learning. 


### Passive reading 

Passive reading (or rereading) is a waste of time. 

### Letting highlights overwhelm you

Highlighting your text can fool your mind into thinking you are putting
somehting meaningful into your brain, when all you're really doing is moving
your hand. 

A little highlighting here and there is okay -- sometimes it can be helpful in
flagging important points. 

But if you are using highlighting as a memory tool, make sure what you mark is
going into your brain.


### Merely glancing at solution and thinking you know how to do the problem

One of the worst errors a student can make during studying. 

You need to be able to solve a problem step by step without looking the
solution. 

### Repeatedly solving known problems

You are not preparing yourself for a test. 

### Neglect to read textbook before working on problems

Textbook is your guide towards answers. 

Before you begin to read, take a quick glance over the chapter or section to
get a sense of what the text is about. 


### Not checking with instructor or with your peers 

### Distraction  

More interrupted distraction results in less time and effort to devote
yourself to learning. 

### Not getting enough sleep.

Prolonged fatigue allows toxins to build up in the brain that disrupt the
neural connections you need to think quickly and well.
