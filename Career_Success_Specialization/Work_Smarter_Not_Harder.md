### Two ways to save time.

You can find a million ways to save minutes. 

> You don't build the life you want by saving time. You build the life you want,
> and then time saves itself. 

Rather than looking to save bits of time here and there, start by asking
yourself exactly what you're saving that time for. 

Make a list of anything you want to do more of in your life. 

- Is it getting to the gym?
- Is it hanging out with friends? 

Commit to scheduling in at least one such activity per week ideally in a way
that makes it impossible to wriggle out of it. 

Focus on the big stuff. 

It's fine to figure out a more efficient way to unload the dishwater. 

A better approach is to track your time for a few days - or a week. And, take a
honest look at what is and isn't adding value to your life. 

### When we have bits of time we filled them, but not with things that matter. 

>"We often, maybe even mostly, let our schedule schedule itself; Ignorning the fact that time, not money, is our only true leadership asset." - Tom Peters

Do you watch TV shows at night you don't care about? Go to bed earlier and get
up earlier, and turns those uproductive evening hours into productive ones. 

Are you running errands on weekends mornings when you could get those items
delivered? Those hours can be repurposed for hobbies, or going out for brunch
with your family. 

**Sometimes we get so obsessed with saving bits of time we fail to see the big
picture starting at us.** Saving two minutes doesn't do much for you. Canceling
a weekly two hour meeitng that's long outlived its usefulness? That time really
does add up.

## Time is a limited resource.

### Time tracking

Keep yourself honest.

Time tracking allows oneself to reveal what is actually done throughout the
day. 


Spend on time on the task that benefical to you. 


There's no exact formula for work life balance. It's a personal decision depends on your values and
how your value changes. Prioritize and drop tasks accordingly. 


The correct formula for work life balance is to spend your time in a way that
supports your goals. 

Strategic reserve time is time remaining after you have performed your basics
job functions. 

Basic job functions = How many hours to complete this work 

Strategic reserve time = time available to work - all scheduled work

Time available to do all tasks - all commitments = Strategic reserve time 

Create your own strategic reserve time chart 

If your management does not use strategic reserved time or something similar to
allocate your time you should consider discussing your findings with them, if
you believe the management are open to dicussion. 



### You teach people how to treat you. 

Here's a story to illustrate "You teach people how to treat you."

1. Your demanding boss would text you 24 hours a day. 
2. You are tired and stressed. At 2 am. you heard a text while sleeping and
   wake up to reply to the text.
3. Did you read the job description and about the expectations that had been
   set when you first joined the company? 
4. Does everyone in the office answer your boss 24/7? 
5. In order to make a good expression on your boss, you are setting the example
   by being available 24/7. 
6. You taught your boss that you will be on call 24/7. 

You teach people how to treat you and unless otherwise specified in your job
description, it's okay to set some boundaries. 



## Little Tips That Make a Big Impact 

### Keep a log
Keep a log of the work you do, time to complete the task, and, description of the
task. 

Let's say you have a task took 3 hours longer and a variance of negative one. 

Now, you want to gather the reason for the variance. Why did the taks took you
longer to complete? That's what you will learn from. 

Variance = time estimate to complete task - how long the task actually took to
complete 

Analogus estimating is comparing similar finished work in order to find a time
to estimate to complete a new work. 

To estimate repetitive task, use parametric estimating. 

Parametric estimating = x minutes to do a task * y number of task

The best estimates comes from your experience. 

When you improve your estimating, you are going to improve your productivity
because you know much you can really do in a certain day. You will be more
effective in your job. And, your reputation will improves. 


## Managing tasks and communications


### Keep your focus on delayed delivery

Schedule specific time for communication. 

Emails keeps coming in. Do not looka at each indvidual email. 

If emails are not urgent, you can respond with delayed
delivery at the end of your work day. 

You can spend the rest of your day
working on your work. 


### Do no-reply task immediately

Actionable task with less than 2 minutes or less. You can do the task
immediately and get the task out of the way. 

If the informational task has nothing to required of you, do it right away. For
example, put the task into your list, or on your work plan, or your calender.
So you don't forget about it. 

### Classify email

Classify emai by your inbox folders 
- If it's quick to do -> **Do it** folder
- Informational email -> **Infromation** folder
- Actionable email -> **Action** folder -> Schedule your work plan and
  calender
- Email reply -> **Pending** -> Create a reminder on calender

The classification does not only applies to text or email. It can be applied to
other types of task. 

### Keep/schedule similar information/item/task/object together

**Download apps across devices.** Sync data to the cloud. You can work on the task on different devices wherever
you goes. 


Avoid keeping similar information in different applications or locations. 

For example, avoid having multiple calandars and do not sync them. Color code
your calendars - one color for work, one color for home, one color for volunter
work. 

Avoid wasting time to locate an item or an object. 

Whenever possible, plan your work, so that you perform similar tasks together. 

If you have not completed the document, leave yourself a note on the first page
as to where to start next itme you open the document. 

Whenever possible, schedule your most challenging tasks for the time of the day
you are at your best. If this is not possible, then try to minimize
distractions and try to work at a slower pace, and check and recheck your work
during your difficult time. 

When you need to complete a critical task during the time of day that is
difficult for you, ask someone to act as a reviewer.

## Multitasking 

Multitasking is not as effective as concentrating on one task or thing at a
time. 


> "To do two things at once is to do neither." - Publilius Syrus

Switching cost is the time taken to switch from one task to another, then
another, and back again. 


If you must switch tasks, leave yourself notes as to how to start again. This
minimizes switching costs.

## Habits of highly successful people

Focus and discipline are common traits of highly successful people. 

### Focus one task at a time
When you have a choice, you should focus on one task until the task is
completed or it is time to stop. 

### Positive reinforcement
When you are trying to change your work habits, it's a good idea to reward
yourself when you meet your goal. Positive reinforcement is helpful. 

### Prepare for tomorrow, today.

Before you go to bed, write down everything that's on your brain, things you
are thinking about, what you need to do the next day. 

By spending a few minutes every night getting what's your on mind into a note
for yourself, you can quiet your inner taskmaster, get a good night sleep. Get
    up in the morning and be ready to start the day with notes from yesterday. 


### Power down the distractions 

Close all the applications. Focus and look at the task you want to accomplish.
